# odin-landing-page

The second project, realised as a part of curriculum on The Odin Project.
I realised it according to a "draft" pic and a set of help declarations, but I chose to modify the content in index.html heavily, leaving only the Norse mythology element. :)

Thank you to the folks at The Odin Project for the fun assignment!

I am the author of all the images used on the landing page.
